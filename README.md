## Starting Airflow

Before we run Airflow, let's create these folders first:

```sh
mkdir -p mnt/dags mnt/logs mnt/plugins mnt/tests
```

On **Linux**, please make sure to configure the Airflow user for the docker-compose:

```sh
echo -e "AIRFLOW_UID=$(id -u)" > .env
```

With `LocalExecutor`

```sh
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

With `CeleryExecutor`

```sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose-celery.yml build
docker-compose -f docker-compose-celery.yml up
```

With `SequentialExecutor` (NOT recommended for production use)

```sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose-sequential.yml build
docker-compose -f docker-compose-sequential.yml up
```

To clean up the project, press Ctrl+C then run:

```sh
docker-compose down
```

## Airflow S3 Connection to MinIO

Since MinIO offers S3 compatible object storage, we can set the connection type to S3. However, we'll need to set an extra option, so that Airflow connects to MinIO instead of S3.

- Connection Name: `minio` or any name you like
- Connection Type: S3
- Login: `<replace_here_with_your_minio_access_key>`
- Password: `<replace_here_with_your_minio_secret_key>`
- Extra: a JSON object with the following properties:
  ```json
  {
    "host": "http://minio:9000"
  }
  ```

**Note:** If we were using AWS S3, we don't need to specify the host in the extra.

## Running Tests

First we need to install pytest:

```sh
pip install pytest
```

Run tests:

```sh
export PYTHONPATH=/opt/airflow/plugins
pytest
```
